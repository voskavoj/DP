\chapter{Data and Code}
The data collected as part of this thesis and the source code of the navigation system constitute the digital appendix to the thesis. The files were submitted along with the digital thesis document (16 zip files packed separately, each containing one dataset, and one zip file with the source code) and the files are available on GitHub (two zip files, one with experimental data and one with validation data, and one zip file with the source code).

The source code includes a \textit{readme} file with installation and usage instructions.

On GitHub, the data and the source code can be downloaded from the Release page of the personal repository of the author:

The data are in several folders, each of which contains the following files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{output.bits} - these are the demodulated frames
    \item \texttt{decoded.txt} - these are the decoded frames 
    \item \texttt{Iridium.txt} - these are the TLEs for Iridium valid at the time of recording
    \item \texttt{log.txt} - this is the log from the data capture
    \item \texttt{saved\_nav\_data.pickle} - these are the processed data ready for navigation calculations
    \item \texttt{test\_nav\_data.pickle} - these are simulated data used for algorithm tuning (not always present)
    \item \texttt{start\_time.txt} - this file includes the timestamp of the recording start
\end{itemize}
