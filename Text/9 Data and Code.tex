\chapter{Data and Code}
The data collected as part of this thesis and the source code of the navigation system constitute the digital appendix to the thesis. The files are available in three places:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the files were submitted along with the digital thesis document (16 zip files packed separately, each containing one dataset, and one zip file with the source code),
    \item the files are contained within the digital carrier within the print version of the thesis (two zip files, one with experimental data and one with validation data, and one zip file with the source code),
    \item and the files are available on GitHub release (same as above).
\end{enumerate}

The source code includes a readme file with installation and usage instructions.

On GitHub, the data and the source code can be downloaded from the Release page of the repository \texttt{voskavoj/DP} (\url{https://github.com/voskavoj/DP} or QR code below).  Additionally, the source code can be viewed with history on GitHub as well. The version valid at the time of thesis submission is tagged \texttt{v1.0} and \texttt{submitted} (\url{https://github.com/voskavoj/DP}). % todo link

The data are in several folders, each of which contains the following files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{output.bits} - these are the demodulated frames
    \item \texttt{decoded.txt} - these are the decoded frames 
    \item \texttt{Iridium.txt} - these are the TLEs for Iridium valid at the time of recording
    \item \texttt{log.txt} - this is the log from the data capture
    \item \texttt{saved\_nav\_data.pickle} - these are the processed data ready for navigation calculations
    \item \texttt{start\_time.txt} - this file includes the timestamp of the recording start
\end{itemize}
